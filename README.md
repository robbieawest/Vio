# Vio
 Vio is my new project for a lighter weight text-editor which is fully configured on install.

 As I intend to implement certain Vi key mapping into Vio, hence the name Vi Odd. This key mapping will be easy to use centered around development using the mouse, and the arrow keys (sacrilege I suppose).

 Vio currently has a simple text editor with work-in-progress functionality
